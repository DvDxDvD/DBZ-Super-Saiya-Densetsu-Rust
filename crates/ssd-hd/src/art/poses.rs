//! Finding the battle poses of a frame: the sprites of the object layer, decoded to palette
//! indexes and assembled into poses, keyed exactly as the capture of the HD art keyed them (so a
//! pose of the frame finds the art made from the same pose).
//!
//! * A fighter is the sprites drawn with OAM palette 1 (the party) or 2 (the enemy); its key is
//!   the first 16 hex digits of the SHA-1 of the trimmed palette-index array (row-major bytes)
//!   followed by the bytes `height, width`. The key is taken over the whole palette group, and
//!   over its clusters of pieces (at most 12 pixels apart) when the group holds debris or sparks
//!   as well.
//! * An effect is a cluster of the sprites of the other palettes (pieces within 4 pixels of each
//!   other, above line 160); its key is the same hash over the trimmed RGBA array, whose colours
//!   are those of each pixel's own scanline (the HDMA gradients change them).
//!
//! * A field group (the party, NPCs, ships and objects of the field) is keyed like a fighter, over
//!   its palette indexes: the frame's visible sprites in OAM order are split into runs of
//!   consecutive entries of one OAM palette, and each run into sets of sprites whose boxes are
//!   within 2 pixels of each other ([`field_groups`]).
//!
//! The decoding of the sprites follows the capture, not the PPU: whole sprites (all their pixels,
//! the ones off the screen too), as the sprite sizes of the frame say.
